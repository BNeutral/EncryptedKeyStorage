# EncryptedKeyStorage
Barebones Python 3 code for keeping keys in an encrypted file, and only spills unencripted contents to ram.

Run with "python3 ./manager.py" from a console. Rest should be self explanatory.

Uses the standalone software only pyscrypt library for ease of use and preservation in the future. See https://github.com/ricmoo/pyscrypt
